Particularly, the task of this project is **Named Entity Recognition**. A primer on this task is provided further on. The given dataset is a modified version of the CoNLL-2003 ([Sang et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0306050v1.pdf)) dataset. Please use the datasets that we have released to you instead of versions found online as we have made simplifications to the dataset for your benefit. Your task is to develop NLP models to identify these named entities automatically. We will treat this as a **sequence-tagging task**: for each token in the input text, assign one of the following 5 labels: **ORG** (Organization), **PER** (Person), **LOC** (Location), **MISC** (Miscellaneous), and **O** (Not Named Entity). More information about the dataset is provided later\n","\n","For this project, you will implement any approach at your will (e.g. one model that is covered in the lecture):\n","<!-- - Model 1 : a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) -->\n","<!-- - Model 2 : a Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM), which is an adaptation of an HMM in which a Logistic Regression classifier (also known as a MaxEnt classifier) is used to obtain the lexical generation probabilities (i.e., the observation/emission probability matrix, so \"observations\" == \"emissions\" == \"lexical generations\"). Feature engineering is strongly suggested for this model! -->\n","\n","<!-- Implementation of the Viterbi algorithm (for finding the most likely tag sequence to assign to an input text) is required for both models above, so make sure that you understand it ASAP. -->\n","\n","<!-- You will implement and train two sequence tagging models, generate your predictions for the provided test set, and submit them to **Kaggle**. Please enter all code in this colab notebook and answer all the questions in the supporting document. -->\n","\n","<!-- To refresh your memory on HMMs, MEMMs, and Viterbi you can refer to **Jurafsky & Martin Ch. 8.3–8.5** and the lecture slides which can be found on EdStem. -->"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kBsjyfPu5V4t"},"source":["## **Named Entity Recognition: A Primer**\n","\n","---\n","\n","Let us now take a look at the task at hand: Named Entity Recognition (NER).
